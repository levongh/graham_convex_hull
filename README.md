# graham_convex_hull
Graham's scan is a method of finding the convex hull of a finite set of points in the plane with time complexity O(n log n).
The algorithm finds all vertices of the convex hull ordered along its boundary. It uses a stack to detect and remove concavities
in the boundary efficiently.
